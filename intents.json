It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region in Belgium, France, and Luxembourg. The German objective was to split the Allied forces, recapture the port of Antwerp, and seize key strategic points. The battle involved fierce fighting in harsh winter conditions, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The key commanders involved were General Dwight D. Eisenhower for the Allies and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt for Germany. Although the Germans initially made significant gains, the Allied forces managed to halt the German advance and ultimately repel them. The Battle of the Bulge is considered a significant Allied victory and marked a turning point in the war in favor of the Allies."
